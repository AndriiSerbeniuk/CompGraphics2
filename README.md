Transformations of 2D objects on a 2D plane.
This was a university assignment.

Implemented affine transformations:
	- translation;
	- rotation (relative to a point, this point can be changed with a mouse click);
	- scaling (relative to a point);
	- reflection (also relative to a point).

Transformations can be applied to the entile object at once or only to some parts of it.
Visible parts of the plane is always following the object, auto scaling can be turned off and changed manually.
